# Setting up the Cordova plug-in
{: #getting-started-cordova}

The {{site.data.keyword.mobileanalytics_full}} SDK allows you to instrument your mobile application.

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin}
* You must have an instance of a mobile backend that is protected by {{site.data.keyword.mobileanalytics_short}} service. For more information about how to create a mobile backend, see [Getting started](getting-started.html).
* Create a Cordova application or use an existing project. For more information about how to set up your Cordova application, see the [Cordova website](https://cordova.apache.org/).


## Installing the {{site.data.keyword.mobileanalytics_short}} Cordova Plug-in
{: #getting-started-cordova-plugin}

The {{site.data.keyword.mobileanalytics_short}} Client SDK for Cordova is a Cordova plug-in that is wrapping the native {{site.data.keyword.mobileanalytics_short}} Client SDKs. It is distributed using the Cordova Command Line Interface (CLI) and `npmjs`, a plug-in repository for Cordova projects. The Cordova CLI automatically downloads plug-ins from repositories and makes them available to your Cordova application.


1. Add iOS and Android platforms to your Cordova application. Run one or both of the following commands from the command line:

	```Bash
	cordova platform add ios
	```
```Bash
	cordova platform add android
	```

1. If you added the Android platform, you must add the minimum supported API level to the `config.xml` file of your Cordova application. Open the `config.xml` file and add the following line to the `<platform name="android">` element:

	```XML
	<platform name="android">  
  	<preference name="android-minSdkVersion" value="15"/>
  	<preference name="android-targetSdkVersion" value="23"/>
  	<!-- add minimum and target Android API level declaration -->
  </platform>
```
The *minSdkVersion* value must be higher than `15`. The *targetSdkVersion* value must be the latest Android SDK that is available from Google.

1. If you added the iOS operating system, update the `<platform name="ios">` element with a target declaration:

	```XML
	<platform name="ios">
    <preference name="deployment-target" value="8.0"/>
     <!-- add deployment target declaration -->
  </platform>
```

1. Install the {{site.data.keyword.mobileanalytics_short}} Cordova plug-in:

 	```Bash
	cordova plugin add ibm-mfp-core
	```

1. Verify that the plugin installed successfully by running the following command:
    ```Bash
     cordova plugin list
		 ```

## Initializing the {{site.data.keyword.mobileanalytics_short}} Client plug-in
{: #getting-started-cordova-initialize}

To use the {{site.data.keyword.mobileanalytics_short}} Client SDK, you must initialize the SDK by passing the *applicationGUID* and *applicationRoute* parameters.

1. Find your route and app GUID values on the main page of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard. Click your app name and then **Mobile Options** to display the **Application route** and **Application GUID** values to initialize the SDK.

3. Add the following call to your `index.js` file to initialize the {{site.data.keyword.mobileanalytics_short}} Client SDK. <br/>Replace the *applicationRoute* and *applicationGUID* with the values from **Mobile Options** in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard.

	```JavaScript
	BMSClient.initialize("applicationRoute", "applicationGUID");
	```



## Making a request to the mobile backend
{: #getting-started-request}

After the {{site.data.keyword.mobileanalytics_short}} Client SDK is initialized, you can start making requests to your mobile backend.

1. Try to send a request to a protected endpoint of your new mobile backend. In your browser, open the following URL: `{applicationRoute}/protected`. For example:
```
http://my-mobile-backend.mybluemix.net/protected
```
<br/>The `/protected` endpoint of a mobile backend that was created with MobileFirst Services Starter boilerplate is protected with {{site.data.keyword.mobileanalytics_short}}. An `Unauthorized` message is returned in your browser. This message is returned because this endpoint is accessed only by mobile applications that are instrumented with {{site.data.keyword.mobileanalytics_short}} Client SDK.

1. Use your Cordova application to make a request to the same endpoint. Add the following code after you initialize `BMSClient`:

	```JavaScript
	var success = function(data){
		console.log("success", data);
	}

	var failure = function(error){
		console.log("failure", error);
	}

	var request = new MFPRequest("/protected", MFPRequest.GET);

	request.send(success, failure);
	```

1. When your request succeeds, you will see the following output in the LogCat or Xcode console (depending on the platform that you are using):

	![image](images/getting-started-android-success.png)

	## Next steps
	{: #next-steps}

	When you connected to the protected endpoint, no credentials were required. To require your users to log in to your application, you must configure Facebook, Google, or custom authentication.
