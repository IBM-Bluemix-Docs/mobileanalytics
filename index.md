##Demo mode

**Demo mode** option is available in the {{site.data.keyword.mobileanalytics_short}} console, whereby the views and charts display **demo data**. 
Demo mode is the default mode of the console when it initially launches after the service is instantiated. When you have your own applications and analytics data populated into the service, you can toggle *off* the demo mode to view your application's data in the different charts. The {{site.data.keyword.mobileanalytics_short}} console is read-only when in demo mode, therefore you will not be able to create new alert definitions.
